This is a Python webserver that uses Twilio in order to communicate with users. It uses natural language processing in order to decide what script it want's to call. It supports getting information from Wikipedia, Twitter and Reddit. 

It also supports sentiment analysis and will tell you a joke if it detects you're feeling sad and no other scripts were called.
